# Stochastic Origin Ensemble (SOE)
Iterative algorithm

##Pre-requirements:
ROOT (https://root.cern.ch/)


##Getting started:
Instruction to compile and execute the algorithm:

```
make
```
If this task is successful, you should have produce: image.exe
Now you can run:

```
./image.exe
```

This runs the algorithm and produced two file:
density.img and ntuple.root

If you want to visualise the resulting image, type:

```
root -l plotImage.C
```
